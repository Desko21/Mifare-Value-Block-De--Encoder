# Mifare-Value-Block-Decoder-Encoder
Very simple encoder/decoder of mifare block.<br>
Couldn't find a free one online, so I made one by myself.

<b>How to Decode a value block as Int:</b><br>
insert your block value and press <i>DECODE</i>.


<b>How to Encode:</b><br>
insert your block value, put your new int you wanna encode and press <i>ENCODE</i>.

Easy!
